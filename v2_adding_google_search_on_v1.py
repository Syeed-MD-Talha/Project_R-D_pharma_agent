This image contains a handwritten prescription. Please analyze it and provide:

TASK:
    Carefully analyze the uploaded prescription image and extract:
    1. Your interpretation of each medicine name in the prescription
    2. For each medicine name, assign a confidence percentage (0-100%)
    3. Format each line as "Medicine Name: [confidence]%"
    4. All medicine names (which may be handwritten in English or Bangla)
    5. Dosage instructions for each medicine (e.g., 0+0+1/2, 1+1+1, etc.)
    6. Any special instructions for taking the medicines
    
    IMPORTANT NOTES:
    - DO NOT try to validate or correct medicine names yet
    - Extract exactly what you see, even if the spelling seems unusual
    - For unclear text, provide your best interpretation and note uncertainty
    - Dosage notation typically follows patterns like 0+1+0 (morning+noon+night)
    
    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    ```
    EXTRACTED MEDICINES:
    
    Medicine 1:
    - Name: [exactly as written ]
    - Dosage: [frequency pattern]
